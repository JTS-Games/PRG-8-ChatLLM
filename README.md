The project is seperated into client and server.

First, clone the project to your own machine.


On the server side, run NPM install. Then, go to package.json and run server.

On the client side, run NPM install. Then go to package.json and run dev.


If dev and server don't wanna start, check if you did install on each project seperately.
If calls can't be completed, check if the server is running correctly.
If the site doesn't load, check if the localhost is running correctly
